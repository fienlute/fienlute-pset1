1. First I made two views in my main view. One for mister p and one for the buttons. I made sure that the views were next to each other when the phone was held horizontally.
2. Then I put the images of mister potatohead in the view. I made sure he looked like I wanted him to. 
3. Next I started to make buttons with a label for each element of mister potatohead (accept from the body, which is always there)
4. Then I started to link the buttons to the elements and made sure that the element was hidden if the button was off and would appear when the button was turned on.
